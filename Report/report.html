        <h1>What makes a Hall of Famer, a Hall of Famer?</h1>
        <p>
          There are around 23,000 players that have played in the MLB, and surprisingly not all make
          it to the Hall of Fame -- it is considered a life achievement, after all. So, who in the hell makes it? Is it juiced up ARod or diligent players like Ichiro?
        </p>
        
        <p>In this report, we use Logistic Regression to uncover what kind of factors go into deciding whether or not a player is inducted to the hall of fame.</p>

          Of the 23,000 MLB players, roughly around 5000 players are eligible. <a class="desc"> Players must have played 10 seasons of Major League Baseball and have been retired from for five full seasons to be considered eligible.</a>

          Further, of these 5000 eligible players, there are only 330 players that have been voted to the hall of fame. That is 6.6% of the eligible players end up making it through.

        <h3>And about 1% of all players...</h3>
