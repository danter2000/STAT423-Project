Our group will be focusing on uncovering what kind of factors are most valuable in predicting whether or not a player makes it to Cooperstown. We'll also be looking for any outliers and other unusual data to see if our model can possibly pick out players that have been *juicing*.

Enjoy this definition of juicing, courtesy of ChatGPT:

> Juicing refers to the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in Major League Baseball (MLB). This issue has been a source of controversy in the league, as it raises questions about the fairness of the competition and the health risks associated with PED use. The MLB has implemented various measures to detect and prevent juicing, including testing and suspension policies, but some players have still been caught using PEDs. This has led to public scrutiny and calls for stricter enforcement of the rules, as well as increased efforts to educate players about the dangers of juicing and alternative ways to improve performance. Despite these efforts, the issue of juicing remains a persistent problem in the MLB.

Enjoy this weird fact:

> Another weird baseball fact is that a game was once played in a cornfield. In 1908, a minor league game between the Topeka Jayhawks and the Quincy Indians had to be moved to a cornfield due to heavy rain that made the regular field unplayable. The game was played with makeshift bases, and the cornstalks served as the outfield fence. Despite the strange conditions, the game was reportedly a high-scoring affair, with the final score ending up 11-8 in favor of Topeka. This game is considered one of the most bizarre events in baseball history.
