        <h1>What makes a Hall of Famer, a Hall of Famer?</h1>
        <p>
          There are around 23,000 players that have played in the MLB, and surprisingly not all make
          it to the Hall of Fame. It is considered a life achievement, after all.
        </p>

      <section class="step">
        <p>
          Of the 23,000 MLB players, only around 1600 players are eligible.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class='step'>
        <p>
          Further, of these 1600 eligible players, there are only 330 players that actually make it to Cooperstown
        </p>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
          So, what are the characteristics of these 330 Hall of Famers?

        <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
        Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the
        students which are male or female?
        In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and
        the grey bubbles represent the more gender
        balanced courses.
        <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

        What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are
        either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
        with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.

        When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students
        in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges.
        It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with
        higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
        would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the
        median annual salary drops by $306 USD.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender
        distributions. But what are students
        actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual
        interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles
        sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category.
        <svg id='legend3' width='400px' height='350px'></svg>
        Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business
        related topics such as general business, business management,
        accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.

          Hopefully, this has helped you in deciding what major you hope to study. If you want to
          take a deeper look into the data for yourself, you can download
